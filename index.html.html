<font color="black" size="5"face="algerian">The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the name describing the
 galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished
 by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek, meaning "milky circle.From Earth, the
 Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into 
individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the
 Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed 
that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.The Milky Way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km per second with
 respect to extragalactic frames of reference. The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably
 formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.</font><br>

<font color="red" size="5"face="algerian">Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – the planets Mercury,
 Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids,
 comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</font><br>

<img src="C:\Users\162548\Downloads/sun.jpg"HEIGHT=500 WIDTH=600 ALIGN="center"></body><br>
<font color="red" size="5"face="algerian">The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of
 hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light,
 ultraviolet, and infrared radiation. It is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
The Sun's diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth,
 comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen the rest is
 mostly helium , with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.Every second, the Sun's core 
fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, and in the process converts 4 million tons of matter into energy. This energy, which
 can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core 
has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and 
temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant.</font><br>

<img src="C:\Users\162548\Downloads/moon.jpg"HEIGHT=500 WIDTH=600 ALIGN="center"></body><br>
<font color="red" size="5"face="algerian">The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth,
 it is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System, the largest satellite in the Solar System relative to its major planet, and 
larger than any known dwarf planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite 
planet under the geophysical definitions of the term. It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface
 gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g). Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface
 gravity and density.The most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the Moon formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth, 
out of the debris from a giant impact between the planet and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. It then receded to a wider orbit
 because of tidal interaction with the Earth. The near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic maria , which fill the spaces
 between bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters. Most of the large impact basins and mare surfaces were in place
 by the end of the Imbrian period.</font><br>

<font color="red" size="5" face="copperplate gothic black">
The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.
From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would
 be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title
 belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.
Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some 
parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset.</font></p><br>
<font color="Orange" size="7" face="algerian">Venus</font><br>
<img src="C:\Users\162548\Downloads/venus.jpg" align="right">
<font color="red" size="5" face="copperplate gothic black">Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor
. It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density. 
These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds.
Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric
 acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer 
to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The surface
 is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s possible some
 volcanoes are still active.
Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to the pressure you'd encounter a mile 
below the ocean on Earth.
Another big difference from Earth – Venus rotates on its axis backward, compared to most of the other planets in the solar system.
 This means that, on Venus, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east, opposite to what we experience on Earth. </font><br>

<font color="red" size="5" face="copperplate gothic black"><br>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we
 know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.
While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the
 surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. 
However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</font><br>
<font color="Orange" size="7" face="algerian">Mars</font><br>
<img src="C:\Users\162548\Downloads/mars.jpg"><br>
<font color="red" size="5" face="copperplate gothic black">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in Solar System,
being larger than only mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of Roman God of war. Mars is a terrestial planet with a thin atmosphere,and has a
 crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust,as well as a core made of iron and nickel.Mars has surface feature such as impact craters,
valleys,dunes and polar ice caps. It also has two  small and irregularly shaped moons,<b>Phobos</b> and <b>Deimos</b></font><br>

<img src="C:\Users\162548\Downloads/jupiter.jpg" align="right">
<font color="red" size="5" face="copperplate gothic black">
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times 
that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third
 brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after
 the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods.Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of its mass and
 one-tenth of its volume. It probably has a rocky core of heavier elements,[16] but, like the other giant planets in the Solar System, it 
lacks a well-defined solid surface. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than it receives from the Sun. Because
 of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere 
is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the
 Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since at least 1831. </font><br>

<img src="C:\Users\162548\Downloads/saturn.jpg" align="center"><br>
<font color="red" size="5" face="copperplate gothic black">Saturn is the sixth planet From the Sun and second most largest planet after Jupiter.
It has a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and half times that of earth. It has only one-eigth average density on Earth.
However with its larger volume,Saturn is over 95 times more massive than Earth.Saturn's interior is most likely to be composed of a 
core of iron-nickel and silicon and oxygen comopounds. Its core is sorrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer
of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium,and finally,a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a plane yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in the upper
atmosphere.</font><br>
<font color="Orange" size="7" face="algerian">Uranus</font><br>
<img src="C:\Users\162548\Downloads/uranus.jpg"><br>
<font color="red" size="5" face="copperplate gothic black">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek
 god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and
 father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is
 similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and
 Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets.
As with gas giants, ice giants also lack a well defined "solid surface." Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its
 primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other
 hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F),
 and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds.
The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.</font><br>

<img src="C:\Users\162548\Downloads/neptune.jpg"><br>
<font color="red" size="5" face="copperplate gothic black">Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In 
the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17
 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus
 because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. It is referred to as one of the solar system's
 two ice giant planets (the other one being Uranus).Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen 
and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as water, 
ammonia and methane. However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock.</font><br><hr color=blue>
<font color="Orange" size="7" face="algerian">Do you know some other planets of the solar system that are considered as dwarf planets
 recently by the scientists?</font><br>
<font color="brown" size="6" face="copperplate gothic black"><li>Pluto</li></font>
<img src="C:\Users\162548\Downloads/pluto.jpg"><br>
<font color="orange" size="5" face="copperplate gothic black">Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the 
orbit of Neptune. It was the first object discovered in the Kuiper belt and remains the largest known body in that area. After Pluto
 was discovered in 1930, it was declared the ninth planet from the Sun. However, beginning in the 1990s, its status as a planet was 
questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc, including the dwarf 
planet Eris, leading the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 to define the term planet formally—excluding Pluto and reclassifying
 it as a dwarf planet.Pluto is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun. It is the largest known trans-
Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is 
relatively small—one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume.<br></font>
<font color="brown" size="6" face="copperplate gothic black"><li>Ceres</li></font>
<img src="C:\Users\162548\Downloads/ceres.jpg"><br>
<font color="orange" size="5" face="copperplate gothic black">Ceres is a dwarf planet in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. 
Ceres was the first asteroid discovered, on 1 January 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi at Palermo Astronomical Observatory in Sicily. Originally considered
 a planet, it was reclassified as an asteroid in the 1850s after the discovery of dozens of other objects in similar orbits. In 2006, it was 
reclassified again as a dwarf planet – the only one always inside Neptune's orbit – because, at 940 km (580 mi) in diameter, it is the only
 asteroid large enough for its gravity to maintain it as a spheroid in hydrostatic equilibrium.
Ceres's small size means that even at its brightest it is too dim to be seen by the naked eye, except under extremely dark skies.
Dawn found Ceres's surface to be a mixture of water ice and hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clay. Gravity data suggest Ceres to be 
partially differentiated into a muddy (ice-rock) mantle/core and a less-dense but stronger crust that is at most 30% ice by volume. Ceres's 
small size means that any internal ocean of liquid water it may once have possessed has likely frozen by now. It is not completely frozen,
however: brines still flow through the outer mantle and reach the surface, allowing cryovolcanoes such as Ahuna Mons to form at the rate of
 about one every 50 million years. This makes Ceres the closest known cryovolcanic body to the Sun.</font><br>
