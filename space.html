<font color="black" size="5"face="algerian">A constellation is an area on the celestial sphere in which a group of visible stars forms
 a perceived pattern or outline, typically representing an animal, mythological subject, or inanimate object.
The origins of the earliest constellations likely go back to prehistory. People used them to relate stories of their beliefs, 
experiences, creation, or mythology. Different cultures and countries adopted their own constellations, some of which lasted into 
the early 20th century before today's constellations were internationally recognized. The recognition of constellations has changed 
significantly over time. Many changed in size or shape. Some became popular, only to drop into obscurity. Some were limited to a single 
culture or nation.The 48 traditional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in Aratus' work Phenomena and Ptolemy's Almagest, 
though their origin probably predates these works by several centuries. Constellations in the far southern sky were added from the 15th 
century until the mid-18th century when European explorers began traveling to the Southern Hemisphere. Twelve ancient constellations belong 
to the zodiac (straddling the ecliptic, which the Sun, Moon, and planets all traverse). The origins of the zodiac remain historically uncertain
 its astrological divisions became prominent c. 400 BC in Babylonian or Chaldean astronomy.</font><br>

<font color="black" size="5"face="algerian">The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, located roughly between the 
orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. It contains a great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies, of many sizes, but much smaller than planets
, called asteroids or minor planets. This asteroid belt is also called the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid 
populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids.
The asteroid belt is the smallest and innermost known circumstellar disc in the Solar System. About half its mass is contained in the four
 largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea.The total mass of the asteroid belt is about 4% that of the Moon.
Ceres, the only object in the asteroid belt large enough to be a dwarf planet, is about 950 km in diameter, whereas Vesta, Pallas,
 and Hygiea have mean diameters less than 600 km.The remaining bodies range down to the size of a dust particle. The asteroid 
material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident.[6] Nonetheless, collisions between 
large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an asteroid family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. 
Individual asteroids within the asteroid belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups - carbonaceous, silicate,
 and metal-rich.</font><br>

<font color="black" size="5"face="algerian">A meteoroid is a small rocky or metallic body in outer space.
Meteoroids are significantly smaller than asteroids, and range in size from small grains to one-meter-wide objects. Objects smaller than this are
 classified as micrometeoroids or space dust. Most are fragments from comets or asteroids, whereas others are collision impact debris 
ejected from bodies such as the Moon or Mars.
When a meteoroid, comet, or asteroid enters Earth's atmosphere at a speed typically in excess of 20 km/s, aerodynamic heating of that object produces a
 streak of light, both from the glowing object and the trail of glowing particles that it leaves in its wake. This phenomenon is called a meteor or
 "shooting star". Meteors typically become visible when they are about 100 km above sea level. A series of many meteors appearing seconds or minutes
 apart and appearing to originate from the same fixed point in the sky is called a meteor shower. A meteorite is the remains of a meteoroid that has
 survived the ablation of its surface material during its passage through the atmosphere as a meteor and has impacted the ground.</font>
